## Chance of being a California Hispanic student attending UC Berkeley

Take a 20-some year-old student (e.g. 20, 21, 22 years-old). For illustration
purposes, let us consider a student born in California around 2001-2002.

According to the CDC, <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_10.pdf>, 
there were 529,357 live births in California in 2002. Of these, 263,061 were 
Hispanic live births (230,386 Mexican in case you are curious)

To make the math easier, let's assume that there were 250,000 Hispanic babies
born in California per year during the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004. Or put
another way, there were one million Hispanic babies born in California during
these four years. The actual number might be a bit higher but let's cap it to 
1 million.


### UC Enrollment Data (2023)

Based on UC enrollment data, in the Fall 2023 semester there were about 5327
Hispanic undergraduate students enrolled in UC Berkeley.

### So, what are the odds?

What does this mean? Well, assuming you are a Hispanic born in California 
during 2001-2004 or so, your chances of attending UC Berkeley are about:

```{r}
5327 / 1000000
```

Or basically 1 in 200 (1/200).
