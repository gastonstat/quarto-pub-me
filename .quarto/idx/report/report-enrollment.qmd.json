For illustration\npurposes, let us consider a student born in California around 2001-2002.\n\nAccording to the CDC, <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_10.pdf>, \nthere were 529,357 live births in California in 2002. Of these, 263,061 were \nHispanic live births (230,386 Mexican in case you are curious)\n\nTo make the math easier, let's assume that there were 250,000 Hispanic babies\nborn in California per year during the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004. Or put\nanother way, there were one million Hispanic babies born in California during\nthese four years. The actual number might be a bit higher but let's cap it to \n1 million.\n\n\n### UC Enrollment Data (2023)\n\nBased on UC enrollment data, in the Fall 2023 semester there were about 5327\nHispanic undergraduate students enrolled in UC Berkeley.\n\n<https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/fall-enrollment-glance>\n\n![Figure 1: UC Berkeley Enrollment Data, Undergraduates Fall 2023](uc-berkeley-enrollment-2023.png)\n\n\n### So, what are the odds?\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, assuming you are a Hispanic born in California \nduring 2001-2004 or so, your chances of attending UC Berkeley are about:\n\n```{r}\n5327 / 1000000\n```\n\nOr basically 1 in 200 (1/200).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"report-enrollment.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":"zephyr","title":"Report"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
