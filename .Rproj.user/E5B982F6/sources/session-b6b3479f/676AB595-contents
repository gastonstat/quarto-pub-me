I am originally from ABC.

I studied _Major XYZ_ because I loved X, Y, and Z.

On a my spare free time I like to read _genre ABC_ books, and watch series about
_DEF_. I also like to bake & bike.

One of my favorite quotes is:

> "I may not have gone where I intended to go, 
> but I think I have ended up where I needed to be".
>
> Douglas Adams, _The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul_


One of my favorite poems is <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51296/ithaka-56d22eef917ec" target="_blank">Ithaka</a> by Constantine P. Cavafy. But I also like the poems
by <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Vallejo" target="_blank">Cesar Vallejo</a>.

Have I mentioned that I love PB&J?

My favorite colors are `#FF0000` and `#FFFFFF`.

Last but not least ...
